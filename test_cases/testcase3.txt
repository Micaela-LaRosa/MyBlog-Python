Test Case 3: Editing a Blog Entry by User with Editing Permissions

Objective: 
Verify that a user with editing permissions can modify an existing blog entry.

Steps (Initial, Unsuccessful Case):

1.Log in as a user with editing permissions.
Attempt to log in with valid credentials.
Verify user credentials and permissions are correct.
If access is denied, review user permissions within the system.

2. Navigate to the detail page of a blog entry.
Identify the specific entry to be edited.
Confirm that the blog entry detail page loads correctly.
If there are navigation errors, check URL routing and configuration within the project.

3. Select the edit option.
Locate and select the link or button that allows editing of the blog entry.
Ensure that the user interface correctly displays editing options for the user with appropriate permissions.
If the edit option is unavailable, review permission settings in the class-based views or functions handling blog editing.

4. Modify one of the fields (title, subtitle, body text, image).
Make changes to fields in the blog entry, such as title, subtitle, body text, or attached image.
Confirm that changes made are correctly reflected in the editing forms and views.
If changes are not saved correctly, review validation methods and saving logic in the Blog model and edit views.

5. Save the changes made.
Click the save or update button to save the changes made to the blog entry.
Verify that the system processes the update request correctly and that the data is saved in the database without errors.
If there are errors during saving, review error messages returned by Django and ensure there are no validation restrictions or business logic preventing the update.

Modifications Made to Resolve the Issue:

1- User Permission Correction:
Verified and adjusted user permissions within the Django authentication system to ensure the user has the correct role and permissions to edit blog entries.

2- URL Routing and Configuration Correction:
Reviewed and adjusted URL routing and configuration within the project to ensure correct navigation to the blog entry detail and edit pages.

3- Validation and Saving Methods in the Blog Model:
Reviewed and corrected validation and saving methods in the Blog model to ensure that changes made to blog entries are saved correctly in the database.

4- Error Handling and Validation Messages:
Improved error handling and validation messages in edit views and forms to provide clear feedback to the user in case of errors during blog entry editing and saving.

Final Expected Outcome: 
The changes made enable users with appropriate permissions to effectively edit blog entries, ensuring that modifications are saved correctly and reflected accurately in the user interface and database.
